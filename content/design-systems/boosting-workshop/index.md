  <Heading level={3}>
    Interviewing the stakeholders, about 1-2 hour in total
  </Heading>
  <Paragraph>
    I interview your designers, developers, managers, and all people related to creating, using, and supporting your design system. Ideally, I would get different viewpoints: the design system team (developers, designers), the project team(s), the management. You can select who would be a good source of the interview up to your organization possibilities.

    Getting insights

    I gather all the information and analyze it to form the full picture of your design system structure and status, outline the issues, and potential focus areas.

    Preparation of presentation and exercises
  </Heading>
  <Paragraph>
    By the defined focus, I clarify the workshop day structure and align it with you. I prepare relevant exercises on the outlined topics and with relation to the obtained insights. The exercises should fit one day and include collaborative ideation on the outlined problems with commonly-used tools (Figma, Miro, Google Sheets) and custom-tailored playgrounds. We can specify the tools if you have preferences.
