    Yet another frontend developer's blog

---
I am a design systems specialist and a front-end developer originally from the Utmost North 
([Petrozavodsk](http://maps.yandex.com/-/CVR3nIPf),
Karelia); currently living in Helsinki
and working for [Intergalactico â€“ Nordcloud Design Studio](https://www.intergalactico.io/).<br/>
Before, I had been living Amsterdam for less than a year and previously in
[Moscow](http://images.yandex.com/yandsearch?text=Moscow), Russia for 5 years
and working for
[Yandex](http://www.yandex.com/).<br/>
According to official papers, my name is `Varvara Stepanova`, although most people just call me `Varya`.

More than 4 years I was a member of
the [BEM](http://bem.info/) team.
In there, I worked on  open-sourcing the full technological stack that powers the Yandex UI framework.
As a BEM adept, I still use the solutions in my current work and personal
projects.

Besides the actual development of components, libraries and tools, I frequently speak at tech
conferences, usually explaining the BEM methodology. I write articles in English and Russian, as well as
tutorials and training projects to help developers perform their first dive into
BEM.
There are some links on the [content](en/content/) page for your browsing pleasure.

In my spare time (haha), I study in Aalto University at [IDBM](https://www.idbm.aalto.fi/) programme which includes the
topics of Business Design, Service Design, Industry and Market Researches and assumes a lot of project work.

I am keen on traveling and dream of having friends all over the world.
If you're interested, here's the first personal thing to learn about me: I am passionate about cats, all of them (lions included).

On this site I publish my day-to-day writings as well as links to
articles, projects and presentations.

This site is available in both English and [Russian](/ru).

Here are some obligatory (but useful) links as well:
