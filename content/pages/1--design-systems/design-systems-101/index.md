    During this workshop participants will get a hands-on experience with basic design processes while creating and maintaining their own design system. You'll learn how following these processes helps with establishing a well documented universal design
    language which reflects a shared understanding of the brand and translates into the
    design-system implementation in code and design tools.

1-day workshop for designers, project owners/managers and developers who would like to widen their perspective. During the workshop, the participants get an introduction into the concept of design systems, study the existing solutions and apply them in the context of their company/project. The workshop exercises offer to practice basic design processes when creating and maintaining your own design system.

Ever wondered what is a design system and how is it different to a component library? Or how to introduce a design system to your product or organisation? This one day workshop will help your multi-disciplinary team of designers, developers, and project managers to get familiar with design systems, find design-related issues in your product, and understand how to work around them by improving product-related communication. 

During this workshop participants will get a hands-on experience with basic design processes while creating and maintaining their own design system. You'll learn how following these processes helps with establishing a well documented universal design
language which reflects a shared understanding of the brand and translates into the
design-system implementation in code and design tools. 

With the knowledge of communicational practises and modern design and developer's tools you too should be able to introduce a design system in your company and star working smarter, not harder.
