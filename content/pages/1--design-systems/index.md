title: Design systems
---

My work as a **design system specialist** includes running the processes related to the design and development in large or
regular organizations. It means inventing and shaping the processes through user interviews and data analysis, tuning
the management tools and running new ones, working on company culture and increasing people's involvement, providing
technical infranstructure and guiding in design and development.

In this way, I make a lot of research and discoveries in technical, design and managing aspects. On this page, I present
the public artifacts of my design-systems activity.

## Concepts

* [Pattern journey](/design-systems/pattern-journey/)<br/>
  Visual illustration and explanation of what happens to a pattern on its way from identifying to actual implementation
  and how different the path might be depending on the situation. The Pattern Journey interactive tool helps to make
  more people in the organization involved into co-creation of design and development value under the Design Systems
  umbrella.

## Workshops

* [Hands-on with Design Systems](/design-systems/hands-on-workshop/)<br/>
Full-day workshop about building design system and pattern library (React) in multidisciplinary team. This workshop was
given twice - as a part of DFConf Helsini, and the second time on its own.

* [How to build a Design System as a team](/design-systems/team-process-workshop/)<br/>
Half-day workshop for teams and individuals interested in managing design system teams and running smooth processes for
such projects.

For private running, I shape workshop editions tailored to the needs of a specific company. The same applies to
the conferences.

## Talks, articles and posts

* [Maintaining design systems with proper user
  research](https://medium.com/elisa-design/maintaining-design-systems-with-user-research-3ba5feafc336)<br/>
  Article in Elisa's Medium Publication about the design thinking methods to help when choosing the next steps for the
  design system development and growth.

* [Building design systems that leverage your designers, developers and
  products](http://varya.me/design-systems-thinking/)<br/>
If we compare design systems of several companies, it is visible that this concept has different meanings to different
people. So, how to decide which path to follow and what aspects of design systems should be in focus at your
organisation? In this talk given at WEBdeLDN meetup in London I told a story of managing a design system in a large
company, making decision on its further focus and approaches behind the implementing which include design thinking
methods, community management, and technical tips.

* [Design Systems â€” review of vocabulary and terms](/blog/design-systems-review/)<br/>
Design systems standardise and simplify the process of interface design and development, they bring new
approaches and form their own ecosystem. However, there is no solid understanding of the concepts and terms forming
the design systems. To solve the term inconsistency and provide structured professional language, this article
focuses on the vocabulary used in the design systems domain by observing a range of materials on the topic, from
both academic and popular sources.
