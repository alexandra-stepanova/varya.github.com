Let's start with a story.

<i>

Recently, I was talking about design systems infrastructure at awespme React Finland conference. The day before the
conference, there was a traditional dinner for speakers. I like this tradition, it makes possible for us speakers to
know each other and the conference organizers so that the next days we work as a team to provide very best event. As
usual, we were asking each other what the talks are about. When it was my turn, I started to explain that my talk is
going to be about building infrastructure for a design system and particularly a design system website. One person
interrupted me with a question "A style guide?". And that is the key issue. Many people think that **design system** is
equal to **style guide**. But it is much more, it must be much more. On this page, I show what is a design system from
different perspectives: design, development, project and even business.

## What is a design system for me?

We can have a look on who are the actual or potential users of a design system, and what are their professional needs in
this context.

<comp-project-roles role="developer" side="left"></comp-project-roles>

As a developer using a design system, I would like to have access to release notes, maybe some general documentation
about the system, not only about components separately.

<comp-project-roles role="designer" side="right"></comp-project-roles>

As a designer, I also want to be involved, and have not so much tenhnical but design-focused information.

<comp-project-roles role="owner" side="left"></comp-project-roles>
As a project manager or owner, I need shrinked prepresentation but more information about the upcoming content in the
design system, their roadmap and such plans.

<comp-project-roles role="business" side="right"></comp-project-roles>
And let's keep in mind that there are also business levels. People there would like to have a larger scale picture,
maybe even with numbers of how much we earn or
save.
