When interacting with the product teams, the design system team often gets a lot of valuable suggestions on how to improve the processes. However, these suggestions can only be easy-applicable if the colleagues are in the context of the design system workflows.

As a design system team, document your workflows (plural for a reason). That will help you to define the flows for contribution, even if they are not yet existing but desired — especially if they are yet desired.

From what I've evidenced in many middle-size or large organizations — the dedicated design system teams are often super busy. They are like Shivas with six arms each, doing all the stuff. How to document that all? The answer is — to split the work by type. For example, a team can outline the workflows separately for the following tasks:

1. Creating a new component
1. Providing a visual or UX fix
1. Providing a technical fix

Once done with its own workflow, the team can go further and document the desired process of contributions.
