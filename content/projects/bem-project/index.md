  Legendary BEM methodology, component, and tools developed at Yandex back in 2008. I worked leading a team of five in tight collaboration with 2 other teams creating components, documentation, and supporting dozens of frontend developers. Popularising BEM, especially abroad, was another huge aspect. I managed to tear down the iron curtain.

At Yandex, I worked in BEM team on methodology, technologies, libraries and a toolbox of [BEM](https://en.bem.info/).

- Shaping the concept of BEM as methodology.
- Developing open source libraries of components.
- Providing documentation for the methodology, technologies, tools and libraries.
- Public speaking, running workshops and writing articles about the project concepts.
