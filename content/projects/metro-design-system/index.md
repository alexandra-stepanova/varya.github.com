Metro Design System is a multiperspective product for designers and developers that
helps them create digital experience for millions of METRO customers in 22 countries.

In this project, I take a role of _Product Owner_ to help the team with the strategic
aspects of the system and its day-to-day operations. That role also includes elements
of service design and managing the project.

## Data-driven approach and OKRs

The project goals are set and tracked by the [OKR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) framework.
Mainly, the focus of design system team was to increase the adoption of its
products (libraries of components implemented in different technologies) across the
company. Such an approach assumed creating and constant usage of the metrics system.
The metrics such as amount of products using different libraries and amount of library
components used in these products â€” are frequently and regularly analysed to find out
the potential gaps and forward the team focus to close them.

## Marketing and in-house community management

As a head of the product, I ensure its usage within the company and popularity in the
design and development circles. While the usage of the design system is not mandatory,
it turns out to be very important that people use it on their own will and, at first,
get familiar with it. As specific actions towards this goal, I commit the following:

- Representing the design system to the business levels and communicating its value and impact
- Presenting and reminding about the design system in company's design and development forums
- Regular onbording meeting for recently joined engineers
- Processing the other teams' request to meet their expectations
