Making a design system for [Business Finland](https://designsystem.businessfinland.fi/#/) included workshop and co-creation sessions, UI inventory based on the existing product, implementing and taking into use a light-weight HTML documentation tool, automating testing and updating routines and polishing the maintenance processes. Note the on-site accessibility tests available at the very pages of the components.

In this project, I was working via an amazing [Wonna consultancy](http://wonna.fi/) and together with [Nikita Sherbakov](https://sherbakov.dev/).
