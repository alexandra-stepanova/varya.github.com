    A workshop covering all the main aspects of design system
---

React super start Andrey Okonechnikov and I gave the workshop introducing the design, managerial and communication aspects of design systems. In the workshop, the participants saw the value of common language and well-organized co-creation process, practiced UI inventory, and learned the different shapes of design systems as well as how to choose the most suitable one.

Ever wondered what is a design system and how is it different to a component library? Or how to introduce a design system to your product or organisation? This one day workshop will help your multi-disciplinary team of designers, developers, and project managers to get familiar with design systems, find design-related issues in your product, and understand how to work around them by improving product-related communication.

During this workshop participants will get a hands-on experience with basic design processes while creating and maintaining their own design system. You'll learn how following these processes helps with establishing a well documented universal design
language which reflects a shared understanding of the brand and translates into the
design-system implementation in code and design tools.

With the knowledge of communicational practises and modern design and developer's tools you too should be able to introduce a design system in your company and star working smarter, not harder.
