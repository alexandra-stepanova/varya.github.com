              but how to achieve that in practice? React ecosystem and community already provide a lot of efficient
              open source tools which can be used for building your design
              system infrastructure. With them, you can have the most automated
              development process, high-level interactive documentation for the
              libraries in your system and support contribution practices within
              your organisation.`,
